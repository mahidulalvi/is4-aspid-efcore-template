# is4-aspid-efcore-template

An ASP.NET Core template with dedicated authentication server using IdentityServer4, ASP.NET Core Identity Users and Entity Framework Core.

After initializing a project with this template, Web APIs, MVC applications and SPAs can be added to the root project or can be included as a client object in the `src/AuthenticationServer/Config.cs` file and they can all consume the dedicated authentication server.

See details in IS4 documentation [`here`](https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
